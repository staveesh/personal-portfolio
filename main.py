Seller Dashboard is a product by ePayLater which allows small business owners to keep a track of their purchases, invoices and inventory from large distributors like Metro Cash & Carry. This solution integrates with ePayLater's payment gateway which allows the business owners to either pay upfront or pay using their credit limit (a maximum of INR 25,00,000). My role as a backend engineer on the Seller Dashboard was to introduce features like catalog upload, inventory management, order billing, order refunds and order analytics. Add-ons like an ElasticSearch backed search engine was also implemented for providing seamless look-ups for a range of items in the inventory.",

I also took the ownership of key features for the 'RADD simulation' project through which analysts could estimate the impact of fraud detection models in future. I received PayPal's 'Bravo' recognition for showcasing creative thinking and collaboration skills in internal tool development and support. I participated in many center-wide hackathons and actively volunteered for 'PayPal Gives' activities. I was also fortunate to attend the GIDS (Great International Developer Summit) and present it's highlights to my division.",

Some of the key subjects in the coursework were Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Networks, Linear Algebra, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic and Software Development for Portable Devices. Apart from coursework, I enjoyed teaching C and UNIX programming to first year students when I was a Professional Assistant for the course Computer Programming. It was a different experience altogether as it helped me strengthen my knowledge and engage with the subject even more. In the final year of my undergraduate studies, I worked on a very interesting project in the fields of robotics and IoT. I developed a robot that allows a person to remotely track the health of an elderly person or a patient. This robot is capable of receiving locomotory signals from a remotely located android phone over the internet in real-time. It was a challenging project - involving a deep understanding of internet protocols for video calling, Android OS, and Arduino UNO. I taught myself the basics of Android Programming and Robotics along with the coursework and completed the project successfully. As a result of my efforts, this project was awarded the highest marks in the class. I also showcased this project in an exhibition organized by the college and thoroughly enjoyed discussing it with the attendees. This project boosted my confidence as a Computer Science student and motivated me even more towards realizing my purpose."
